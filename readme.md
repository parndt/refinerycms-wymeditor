# Refinery CMS WYMeditor (the visual editor)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/parndt/refinerycms-wymeditor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/parndt/refinerycms-wymeditor)

Refinery CMS is backed by [WYMeditor](http://www.wymeditor.org/)

It's a standards compliant editor that we've trimmed to only have what we feel
is absolutely necessary. When you're editing the content in a page part you're
using [WYMeditor](http://www.wymeditor.org/).

We have since modified the source code of WYMeditor to allow for a lot of new
features like our custom dialogues however it is all based on the release: WYMeditor 0.5 rc1.

You can also switch to "source" view and edit HTML manually if the visual editor is not playing nice.


## Installation

Simply put this in the Gemfile of your Refinery application:

```ruby
gem 'refinerycms-wymeditor', ['~> 2.0', '>= 2.0.0']
```

Now, run `bundle install`

Next, to install the WYMeditor extension run:

    rails generate refinery:wymeditor


## Custom Selectable Styles in WYMeditor

Some sites require a little more than just your standard bold and heading controls.
This is where the "css" style drop down comes in handy.

It allows your users to select a style you define. You need to edit/create a CSS
file called `theme.css`.

This file should be located in `/public/stylesheets/themes.css`

Inside that file you define your styles like this

```css
.category-name-style-name {
  // apply your CSS rules here
}
```

For example, if I wanted to add a style that allowed my users to highlight their
text a light yellow colour, I would put this

```css
.text-highlight-yellow {
  background: LightYellow;
}
```

Now edit `public/javascripts/admin.js`. We're going to need to tell WYMeditor
that we have some new styles it should load when the editor is loaded.

Currently your ``admin.js`` file will have something like this

```js
var custom_visual_editor_boot_options = {

};
```

If we open `public/javascripts/boot_wym.js` we might see the default inside:

```js
, classesItems: [
  {name: 'text-align', rules:['left', 'center', 'right', 'justify'], join: '-'}
  , {name: 'image-align', rules:['left', 'right'], join: '-'}
  , {name: 'font-size', rules:['small', 'normal', 'large'], join: '-'}
]
```

Let's just breakdown a single WYMeditor line and understand it:

    {name: 'font-size', rules:['small','normal','large'], join: '-'}

`font-size` is the name of the category and `small`, `normal`, `large`
are the actual styles. So for this to match up with the styles in my theme.css
file the class name has to be:

```css
.font-size-small { // CSS rules here }
.font-size-normal { // CSS rules here }
.font-size-large { // CSS rules here }
```

So going back to our text highlighting style above, we make the new style show
up in the editor by changing our `admin.js` file to:

```js
var custom_visual_editor_boot_options = {
  classesItems: [
 Â   {name: 'text-align', rules:['left', 'center', 'right', 'justify'], join: '-'}
    , {name: 'image-align', rules:['left', 'right'], join: '-'}
    , {name: 'font-size', rules:['small','normal','large'], join: '-'}
    , {name: 'text-highlight', rules:['yellow'], join: '-'}
  ]
}
```

## Dialogs that show from WYMeditor

### Page Link dialog

The link dialog lets you link in several different ways:

* To an internal page
* To an external page
* To an email address
* To a resource you've uploaded in the Resources tab.

### Insert Image dialog

Simply lets you select from an existing image found in the Images tab or upload
a new one right within the dialog.
